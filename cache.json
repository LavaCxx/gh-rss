          "description": "pujx233: \n在 B 站刷视频看到一段对话没理解，分别问了一下 GPT 和 DeepSeek ，GPT 的回答实在让人有点大跌眼镜\n现在不知怎么，我上次用 sin 打珠泪，对面被我打爆了（我是新手，没见过全盛珠泪，可以科普一下吗？）\n2024-07-09 16:33\n\n39\n\n回复\n\n\nbili_90544560036\n\n 不知道该怎么说，就这么跟你介绍吧\n珠泪哀歌族·水仙女人鱼→0\n珠泪哀歌族·王国之心→1\n珠泪哀歌族·塞壬人鱼→1\n珠泪哀歌族·小美人鱼→1\n珠泪哀歌族·梅洛人鱼→1\n珠泪哀歌形俱舍怒威族→1\n壹世坏·珍珠世界→1\n俱舍怒维族·芬里尔狼→0\n六世坏·天魔世界→1\n古尖兵·凯尔柏克→0\n古卫兵·阿基多→0\n剑神官·姆多拉→1\n宿神像·凯尔多→1\n朱光之宣告者→1\n卫星闪灵·淘气精灵→0\n混沌魔龙 3→0 怎么理解这段对话？这里的 0 1 3 又是什么意思\n\nGPT O1\n这段对话可能是在谈论某款游戏中的角色、阵营或战力系统。提到的 \"珠泪哀歌族\" 和类似的词汇看起来是游戏中的一些特定阵营、种族或角色，而后面的 0 、1 、3 可能代表这些角色的状态、等级、成就或战力值。\n\n具体来说，0 、1 、3 可能是一个标识，表示某个角色的某种属性。例如：\n\n0 可能表示该角色在当前状态下不可用、未解锁或是低级。\n1 可能表示该角色已解锁、处于正常状态或是中等级别。\n3 可能表示该角色处于高等级或有特别的成就。\n要更准确地理解这段内容，还需要知道具体是哪个游戏的术语。如果有游戏的具体名称，我可以帮助提供更详细的解释。\n\nGPT O3 mini-hign 联网搜索\n这段对话看起来是在讨论一个游戏或某种策略中的角色、种族或单位的状态，具体内容可能与角色属性、成长、表现等有关。根据你的描述，\"珠泪哀歌族\"以及后续的单位名很可能是某个游戏中的专有名称，而“0”、“1”、“3”则可能表示这些单位在某种系统或状态下的特定标记。\n\n通常，类似这样的数字可以有多种可能的含义，比如：\n\n0 可能表示该角色/单位不可用、未激活、未升级或死亡状态。\n1 可能表示该角色/单位处于正常或激活状态，或者是已被升级。\n3 可能是某种特殊状态、阶段或能力的标记，可能意味着更强的状态或特殊效果。\n如果这是一个角色扮演类游戏、卡牌游戏、或某种具有多层次进展的策略游戏，这些数字可能与角色的能力、等级或其他方面的特性相关联。\n\n你提到的“打珠泪”可能是指在游戏中使用某种技能或策略击败对方，而“对面被打爆了”则意味着你成功地打败了对方的角色或者阵容。\n\n如果能提供更多游戏背景或具体的规则信息，我可以帮助你更好地理解这些标记和相关的策略。\n\n这段对话是《游戏王》玩家在讨论\"珠泪哀歌族\"卡组的构成及环境强度，结合你的疑问可以分为三个部分解读：\n\n一、全盛时期珠泪卡组的恐怖之处（ 2022-2023 环境）\n\n核心机制：\n\n通过「水仙女人鱼」等卡片实现精准堆墓，每回合可触发 10+次效果\n\n墓地资源即手牌，融合召唤无需手卡代价（如「塞壬人鱼」墓地融合）\n\n拥有当时最离谱的资源循环：展开同时破坏对手场面+干扰手坑\n\n巅峰配置：\n\n本家浓度：水仙 3+小美人 3+塞壬 3+梅洛 3 （现多数被限制）\n\n外挂体系：俱舍芬里尔狼 3+古尖兵 3 （现全限制）\n\n系统兼容性：可混搭 60 张卡组仍保持恐怖稳定性\n\n环境统治表现：\n\n先攻终场：神官+宿像双封+朱光护航+天魔世界场地\n\n后攻突破：芬里尔狼除外+尖兵堆墓展开\n\n达成率：即使被灰流/陨石仍能继续展开\n\n二、对话中卡表解析（当前残奥会版本）\n\n水仙女人鱼 0：已被禁止使用\n\n芬里尔狼 0/古尖兵 0：现限制 1 （卡表标注可能为可用数量）\n\n天魔世界 1：现环境中关键场地\n\n外挂组件：加入淘气精灵补点，混沌魔龙辅助展开\n\n三、你用\"Sin\"卡组获胜的原因\n\n环境差异：\n\n现珠泪已是残奥会版本（核心卡全进表）\n\n无法达成当年\"说书永动机\"式展开\n\n对局因素：\n\n现珠泪稳定性大降，容易卡手\n\n对手可能不熟悉古早卡组（ Sin 卡组较冷门）\n\n依赖「罪 真实龙」+场地封锁的战术恰好克制残奥会珠泪\n\n建议可观看 2023 年 YCS 赛事录像，感受全盛期珠泪恐怖的回杀能力（平均 T2 击杀率 87%）。当前环境珠泪已从 T0 跌至 T2 ，但仍有一定竞技能力。\n\nGPT 的回答给人一种纯纯的敷衍感觉，DeepSeek 却完美解决了问题。两边差异也太大了\nGPT 的敷衍程度甚至让我怀疑是不是 OpenAI 偷偷给我的模型做了降级处理，但是 IP 检测起来明明是正常的。\n虽然 DeepSeek 足足思考了 30 秒，但是之前 O1-preview 刚出的时候也是会有大量思考的，现在 GPT 的思考时间实在太少了",
