          "description": "damnthatsfunny: 这次过年没有回家，而是偷偷瞒着家人和所有同事，一个人跑到了欧洲，逛了逛英国和爱尔兰。\n令我印象比较深刻的是在伦敦住青旅的那几天。期间遇到一个同宿舍的中年白男，大概四五十岁，宿舍里还有 3 个比利时的妹子和她们的 2 个男性朋友。\n![所住的青旅]( https://i.ibb.co/hFSYsJ2m/IMG20250129171259.jpg “所住的青旅”)\n白男睡觉比较早，第一天晚上我回寝室时他已经睡着，直到第二天下午我才看到他，那时宿舍里只有我和他两个人，他下班回来洗澡，问我喜欢男的女的，是否是 gay ，他说他是双，随后他竟然给我看他的鸡巴，他问我尝试过大麻吗，我也并非谈麻色变之人，因为我之前在意大利也抽过几口，只是并没有任何感觉，据我了解大麻的成瘾性其实比普通香烟还低。我只是有点害怕他会对我做出什么举动，于是我赶紧出门，但是伦敦的街头太冷了，我走了几步路，又返回宿舍了，我想毕竟这是旅馆，他看着也慈眉善目的，大庭广众之下他肯定不会做出什么过分的东西。我回到宿舍，询问得知他是爱尔兰人，在工地干活。\n\n第二天晚上他又睡的很早，比利时的妹子们回来晚了，吵到他了，白男把他们骂了一顿。然后比利时的人下去叫了管理，污蔑说白男动手打了他们，管理把它调到了另一个房间，还把他吼了一顿，实际上白男是有点冤的，毕竟是他休息被人吵到了。我以为这就结束了，不会再见到他了。第二天晚上我去楼下的酒吧，竟然又碰到他了，他主动给我打了招呼，我询问他昨天休息得怎么样，他说他调换房间之后就再没睡着，于是在大厅躺到了天亮。我告诉他今晚是我在伦敦的最后一晚，明天将回到中国。他说“你应该庆祝这最后一晚，你知道，当你离开这里之后，一切又回到现实”。白男也算外向，走过他面前的人，一旦有眼神对视，就会主动向对方问好，他告诉我这是他们的一种习惯。他给了我他的邮箱，告诉我说即使你回到中国，我们也应该保持联系。随后我们出去买了两瓶酒，回来的路上他抽了两口大麻，问我要不要尝试，我抽了几口，根本没有任何感觉。由于大麻是卷到香烟里的，抽得我都吐了，后面我们回到酒吧继续跟周围的人聊天。认识了一对女同，一个来自德国，一个来自瑞士，瑞士的妹子非常温柔，彬彬有礼的样子，我们聊了两个小时，期间出过旅馆到大街上站着干聊，又回到旅馆。后面一直聊到酒吧关门，我跟那对女同交换了 Instagram ，第二天退房，下午又走了两圈，晚上坐飞机回到了中国。",
