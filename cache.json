          "description": "一、前言\nAI 生成代码，早不是新鲜事了，但是 AI 生成微信小程序，似乎还不多见。\n\n究其原因，大概是小程序的开源项目较少，模型训练不好搞。\n上周，我遇到腾讯的同学，得知\"腾讯云开发\"最近有一个大的版本更新，大幅加强了小程序的 AI 能力。我还挺期待的，腾讯自己搞小程序 AI，要比其他人更合适。\n后来，我试用了本次更新的 AI 功能，有一个强烈的感觉，微信小程序可能很快就会成为国内 AI 应用（又称\"智能体\"）的主要载体。\n因为本次更新以后，小程序调用 AI 模型，以及生成智能体，变得非常方便。并且，小程序从 API 到开发工具，都把 AI 整合进去了，整个开发过程都有 AI 辅助，不仅开发效率提高了，而且大量代码可以通过 AI 生成。\n下面就是我的试用过程的介绍和记录。这些功能都是公开的，大部分已经上线，剩下的也即将发布，大家现在就可以跟着做，体验 AI 生成小程序。\n二、云开发助手：进入方法\n我的第一步是体验小程序的\"云开发助手\"（又称云开发 Copilot）。它的作用是通过 AI 加快小程序的开发。\n它的全功能版，目前要通过\"腾讯云开发平台\"网站使用。\n\n此外，还有一个游客版的小程序，可以体验部分功能。如果你手边只有手机，可以先试试游客版。\n\n手机上，点击\"从 AI 开始探索云开发\"，就能进入。\n\n手机版看一下就可以了，正式的开发还是要使用网站。本文下面的内容，都是基于网站的全功能版。\n首先，登录\"云开发平台\"后，页面右下角就会出现小助手图标。\n\n点击它，就能打开\"云开发助手\"。\n\n它的右上角有一个\"全屏\"图标（下图）。\n\n点击进入完整界面。\n\n三、云开发助手：文档功能\n\"云开发助手\"的主要功能如下图。\n\n这些功能可以分成两大类，一类是文档相关的功能，另一类是代码生成。\n先看看文档功能。\n（1）Copilot\n这个功能是 AI 问答引擎，任何关于小程序的问题，都可以…",
