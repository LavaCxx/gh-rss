          "description": "一、前言\nAI 生成代码，早不是新鲜事了，但是 AI 生成微信小程序，似乎还不多见。\n\n究其原因，大概是小程序的开源项目较少，模型训练不好搞。\n上周，我遇到腾讯的同学，得知\"腾讯云开发\"最近有一个大的版本更新，大幅加强了小程序的 AI 能力。我还挺期待的，腾讯自己搞小程序 AI，要比其他人更合适。\n后来，我试用了本次更新的 AI 功能，有一个强烈的感觉，微信小程序可能很快就会成为国内 AI 应用（又称\"智能体\"）的主要载体。\n因为本次更新以后，小程序调用 AI 模型，以及生成智能体，变得非常方便。并且，小程序从 API 到开发工具，都把 AI 整合进去了，整个开发过程都有 AI 辅助，不仅开发效率提高了，而且大量代码可以通过 AI 生成。\n下面就是我的试用过程的介绍和记录。这些功能都是公开的，大部分已经上线，剩下的也即将发布，大家现在就可以跟着做，体验 AI 生成小程序。\n二、云开发助手：进入方法\n我的第一步是体验小程序的\"云开发助手\"（又称云开发 Copilot）。它的作用是通过 AI 加快小程序的开发。\n它的全功能版，目前要通过\"腾讯云开发平台\"网站使用。\n\n此外，还有一个游客版的小程序，可以体验部分功能。如果你手边只有手机，可以先试试游客版。\n\n手机上，点击\"从 AI 开始探索云开发\"，就能进入。\n\n手机版看一下就可以了，正式的开发还是要使用网站。本文下面的内容，都是基于网站的全功能版。\n首先，登录\"云开发平台\"后，页面右下角就会出现小助手图标。\n\n点击它，就能打开\"云开发助手\"。\n\n它的右上角有一个\"全屏\"图标（下图）。\n\n点击进入完整界面。\n\n三、云开发助手：文档功能\n\"云开发助手\"的主要功能如下图。\n\n这些功能可以分成两大类，一类是文档相关的功能，另一类是代码生成。\n先看看文档功能。\n（1）Copilot\n这个功能是 AI 问答引擎，任何关于小程序的问题，都可以…",

Please contact us for advice and alternatives.\n尝试着删除了自定义 moon 的配置，结果节点就变 Active 了。换回自建 moon 的配置，刚开始还行，过几个小时，该节点就又连不上其它节点了。\n不使用自建 moon ，国内不能建立 p2p 直连的节点，访问就太慢了。联想到 zerotier 这个软件的免费版本，早年一个网络节点数限制为 1000 ，后来逐步限制到 500 、100 、25 、15 个，连个用户通知都没有，真心是怀疑这个软件是不是故意这么干的（偷偷限制自建 moon 只能用官方的），逼迫用户升级到付费版本。\n已经开始测试其它替代软件了，不想再忍了。",
