          "description": "一、前言\nAI 生成代码，早不是新鲜事了，但是 AI 生成微信小程序，似乎还不多见。\n\n究其原因，大概是小程序的开源项目较少，模型训练不好搞。\n上周，我遇到腾讯的同学，得知\"腾讯云开发\"最近有一个大的版本更新，大幅加强了小程序的 AI 能力。我还挺期待的，腾讯自己搞小程序 AI，要比其他人更合适。\n后来，我试用了本次更新的 AI 功能，有一个强烈的感觉，微信小程序可能很快就会成为国内 AI 应用（又称\"智能体\"）的主要载体。\n因为本次更新以后，小程序调用 AI 模型，以及生成智能体，变得非常方便。并且，小程序从 API 到开发工具，都把 AI 整合进去了，整个开发过程都有 AI 辅助，不仅开发效率提高了，而且大量代码可以通过 AI 生成。\n下面就是我的试用过程的介绍和记录。这些功能都是公开的，大部分已经上线，剩下的也即将发布，大家现在就可以跟着做，体验 AI 生成小程序。\n二、云开发助手：进入方法\n我的第一步是体验小程序的\"云开发助手\"（又称云开发 Copilot）。它的作用是通过 AI 加快小程序的开发。\n它的全功能版，目前要通过\"腾讯云开发平台\"网站使用。\n\n此外，还有一个游客版的小程序，可以体验部分功能。如果你手边只有手机，可以先试试游客版。\n\n手机上，点击\"从 AI 开始探索云开发\"，就能进入。\n\n手机版看一下就可以了，正式的开发还是要使用网站。本文下面的内容，都是基于网站的全功能版。\n首先，登录\"云开发平台\"后，页面右下角就会出现小助手图标。\n\n点击它，就能打开\"云开发助手\"。\n\n它的右上角有一个\"全屏\"图标（下图）。\n\n点击进入完整界面。\n\n三、云开发助手：文档功能\n\"云开发助手\"的主要功能如下图。\n\n这些功能可以分成两大类，一类是文档相关的功能，另一类是代码生成。\n先看看文档功能。\n（1）Copilot\n这个功能是 AI 问答引擎，任何关于小程序的问题，都可以…",

          "description": "yagamil: 每年除夕前一段时间，我老公一定会开车回老家，打扫卫生、贴对联，还要上坟烧纸。我劝过他很多次：“家里老人都不在了，老家那个院子又破又冷，咱年年跑那么远图啥啊？委托邻居帮忙不行吗？”可他却总是摇摇头，认真地回我一句：“不一样，这不一样。”\n以前过年回老家，的确是一件热闹又幸福的事儿。还没到村口呢，婆婆就站在路边等着了，身上围着棉围裙，手里捂着冻得发红的手指，远远地冲着车喊：“回来了！路上没出啥事吧？”车一停，公公就迎上来帮我们提东西，笑着说：“赶紧进屋，天这么冷，冻坏了吧？”\n家里早就热气腾腾，锅里炖着肉，桌上摆满了瓜子和糖，灶台边是蒸了一屉一屉的大白馒头。孩子们在院子里跑来跑去，鸡飞狗跳，热闹得不行。吃完饭，一家人围着火盆嗑瓜子，聊着这一年的大事小情，院子里亮着灯，年味就那么浓。\n可后来，公婆先后去世了。家里的热闹也随着他们的离开渐渐冷清下来。现在我们开车回去，村子已经不像以前那样人来人往了，路边空荡荡的，连站着张望的人都没了。家门口的老槐树依旧在那儿，可树下没人了，风吹得沙沙响，像在提醒我们，那里再也没有曾经的那份温暖了。\n到了老家，老公打开院门，一阵冷风夹着灰尘扑面而来，屋里到处是蜘蛛网，家具上厚厚一层土。他一声不吭，拿着扫帚从里到外地打扫，连屋檐下的灰都清得干干净净。每扫一处，他都会停下来，发一会儿呆。我看着他，心里说不出的难受。\n他忙完了，坐在院子里的那把破旧椅子上，点了根烟，低头不说话。半晌后，他抬起头看着小院，说了一句：“爸妈在的时候，这里多热闹啊，现在真安静得吓人。”\n贴好对联，他又去坟上清理杂草、烧纸磕头。我跟在后面，看到他低着头念叨：“爸妈，又过年了，我们都挺好，你们也别挂念。”说到一半，他的声音哽咽了。我心头一紧，眼眶也湿了。\n回来的路上，他开着车，没说话。刚出村口没多远，他突然把车停了下来，头埋在方向盘上，肩膀一抽一抽的。我吓了一跳，问他怎么了，他低声说：“以前爸妈总是送咱们到村口，站在那里，看着咱车开远了才回去。现在我走了，他们却没人送了。”\n那一刻，我明白了，他坚持年年回去，不是为了形式，更不是为了面子，而是为了心里那个“家”。那个破旧的小院子，承载着他所有的回忆和牵挂。回去，是他和过去告别的方式，是他心底的一点安慰。他害怕那院子彻底荒了，害怕那里再也没有家的影子。\n老公跟我说：“家没了，但故乡还在。趁我现在还能开车，再回去看看。以后等我真走不动了，想回来，怕是也回不来了。”\n听到这话，我的心一下子揪了起来。我们这些年为了在城市扎根拼命努力，买房子、供孩子读书，却差点忘了，那片曾经的土地，是我们生命的起点，是我们心底最柔软的地方。\n故乡也许已经荒凉了，但它还在那里等着我们。那里有父母留下的记忆，有我们小时候的欢笑，有曾经一家人围坐的热闹和温暖。\n快过年了，你还记得自己多久没回过故乡吗？那个家门口，也许还有一棵老槐树，静静地等着你；那条走了无数次的土路，也许还铺满了黄叶，盼着你的脚步。\n趁还能动，趁还能回，过年了，回家看看吧。 不管你现在有没有钱，家和故乡，永远是你心底最重要的东西。\n转自知乎。\n同感。",
